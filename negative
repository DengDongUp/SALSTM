i have an uneasy feeling .. last 2 times i felt this way was day before the attitude article & when briana came to london .. i may be wrong tho
thursday is thor's day and i'm sore from the thunder of stress that i'm under
" i don't understand the narrative that thor owned the game because of that first pitch . the royals got to him in the 1st & 2nd , right ? "
" <user> if escobar was hurt i would hope you would be calling for thor's suspension . if kc throws up tomorrow , you should have no prob "

curtis is right : #sjsharks forwards coasting back to the d zone is not a formula for success . 3rd line didn't distinguish itself there .
i may well need therapy for what that guy just did to one of my all time favourite david bowie songs ... wtf was that !!! #xfactorliveshows

alright if you hate briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
unless briana was as virgin- the only thing i can tell <user> is dna test ! she wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity ...
just saying briana got pregnant when she had a bf in march/april and louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
" paps : this one if for the sun !! briana : * stands behind louis and poses * so not set up , nope nope nope , not one bit "
in the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see louis not realising that there's briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
so briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby okay then .
